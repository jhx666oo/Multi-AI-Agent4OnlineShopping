# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please **do not** open public issues for security reports.

Instead, report via one of the following channels:
- GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- Email: add-your-security-email-here@example.com

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide a remediation plan if confirmed.

## Scope
Security reports are especially valuable for:
- Tool Gateway authz/authn bugs
- Idempotency and payment confirmation bypasses
- PII leakage via logs/evidence snapshots
- Prompt injection leading to unauthorized tool calls
